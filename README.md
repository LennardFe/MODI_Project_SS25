    This repository contains data for a project focused on developing 
    <strong>gesture-based control systems for IoT objects</strong>, such as smart home lamps. 
    The primary objective is to explore intuitive, movement-based interactions with physical devices using sensor data.

  <p>
    The central <strong>research question</strong> guiding this project is:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>
      To what extent can ultra-wideband (UWB) radio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data 
      be used to reliably distinguish and select between closely spaced physical target objects 
      through deliberate arm movements?
    </strong>
